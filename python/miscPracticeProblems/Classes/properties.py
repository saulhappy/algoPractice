# Declare a PizzaPie class that accepts a total_slices parameter.
# In the instantiation process for an object, assign the parameter to an
# attribute with the same name.

# A PizzaPie object should also be initialized with a _slices_eaten
# protected attribute set to 0.

# Define a slices_eaten property.
# The getter method should retrieve the value of the _slices_eaten attribute.
# The setter method should set a new value for the _slices_eaten attribute
# but only if the argument is less than total_slices.

# Define a percentage property that calculates how much of the pie has been eaten
# (the number of slices eaten divided by the total slices available).
# The percentage property should be read-only.

# See sample execution below
#
