# Let’s say we want to model a Book as a Python object.
# A Book has an author and a publisher, which are characteristics that cannot change.
# A Book also has a page_count, which could be altered if you rip some pages from the book.

# Declare a Book class that accepts author, publisher, and page_count parameters.
# Each of the parameters should be assigned to an attribute.
# The author and publisher attributes should be designated as protected (use an underscore).
# The page_count attribute should be designated public.

# Define a copyright instance method that returns a string with information about the copyright.
# It should look the string below, where “Grant Cardone” is the value of the protected
# author attribute and “10X Enterprises” is the value of the protected publisher attribute.

# => Copyright Grant Cardone, 10X Enterprises

# The public page_count attribute can always be manually modified.
# However, we can still define an instance method that modifies it.

# Declare a rip_in_half instance method.
# If the book has more than 1 page, it should halve the page_count.
# If the book has 1 page or less, it should set the page_count to 0.

# See sample execution below

book = Book(author="Grant Cardone", publisher="10X Enterprises", page_count=10)

print(book.copyright())  # Copyright Grant Cardone, 10X Enterprises

print(book.page_count)  # 10
book.rip_in_half()
print(book.page_count)  # 5.0
book.rip_in_half()
print(book.page_count)  # 2.5
book.rip_in_half()
print(book.page_count)  # 1.25
book.rip_in_half()
print(book.page_count)  # 0.625
book.rip_in_half()
print(book.page_count)  # 0
book.rip_in_half()
print(book.page_count)  # 0
