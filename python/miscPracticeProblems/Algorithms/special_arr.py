You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x.

Notice that x does not have to be an element in nums.

Return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2.

"""

nums = [3, 5]


def specialArray(nums):
    pass


print(specialArray(nums))
