source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

# Test cases:
nums1 = [2,0,2,1,1,0] # ==> [0,0,1,1,2,2]
nums2 = [2,0,1] # ==> [0,1,2]
nums3 = [0] # ==> [0]
nums4 =  [1] # ==> [1]


def sort_colors(nums):
    pass

print(sort_colors(nums1))
