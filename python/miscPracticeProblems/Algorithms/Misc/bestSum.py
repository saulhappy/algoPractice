write a function bestSum(targetSum, numbers) that takes in a targetsum and array of numbers as arguments.
The function should return an array containing the SHORTEST combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum. 
If there is a time for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest. 

bestSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) => [7]
