# Declare a Newspaper class.

# Each Newspaper will have a 'pages' attribute set to an integer
# and a 'sections' attribute set to a dictionary.
# The keys in 'sections' will be strings representing a section (i.e. "Politics")
# and the values will be the starting page for that section (i.e. "A5").

# The length of a newspaper should be equal to the number of pages it holds.

# Indexing the newspaper by a section should return the starting pasge for that section.

# Make it so two newspapers are considered equal if they have the
# same number of pages AND the same number of sections

# EXAMPLE:

# monday_sections = {
#   "Politics": "A5",
#   "Sports": "B2",
#   "Entertainment": "C3"
# }

# tuesday_sections = {
#   "Travel": "A5",
#   "Cooking": "B2",
# }

# wednesday_sections = {
#   "Classifieds": "A5",
#   "Weddings": "B2",
#   "Weather": "C3"
# }

# np1 = Newspaper(pages = 80, sections = monday_sections)
# np2 = Newspaper(pages = 60, sections = tuesday_sections)
# np3 = Newspaper(pages = 80, sections = wednesday_sections)

# print(len(np1))        # 80
# print(len(np2))        # 60
# print(np1 == np2)      # False -- np1 has 3 sections while np2 has 2 sections
# print(np1 == np3)      # True -- both have 80 pages and 3 sections
# print(np1["Politics"]) # "A5"
# print(np2["Cooking"])  # "B2"
