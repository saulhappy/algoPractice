# Add a docstring for the class equal to "Blueprint for a student at an institution of higher learning"

# Define three instance methods — sleep, eat, and party.
# The actual content of the methods is irrelevant (feel free to use the pass keyword)

# The sleep method should have the docstring "Sleep through class".
# The eat method should have the docstring "Go to the cafeteria".
# The party method should have the docstring "Hit the books hard".

# To simplify the test evaluation, submit ALL docstrings without any line breaks.
# Example: """Sample docstring"""
# You're welcome to use single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.

# See sample execution below

# Blueprint for a student at an institution of higher learning
