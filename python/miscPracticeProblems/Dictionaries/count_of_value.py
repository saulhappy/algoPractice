# Declare a count_of_value function that accepts a dictionary and an integer.
# It should return a count of the number of times the integer appears
# as a value among the dictionaryâ€™s values.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# my_dict = { "a" : 5, "b" : 3, "c" : 5 }
#
# count_of_value(my_dict, 5) => 2
# count_of_value(my_dict, 3) => 1
