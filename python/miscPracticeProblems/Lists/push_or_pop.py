# Declare a push_or_pop function that accepts a list of numbers
# Build up and return a new list by iterating over the list of numbers
# If a number is greater than 5, add it to the end of the new list
# If a number is less than or equal to 5, remove the last element added to the new list
# Assume the order of numbers in the argument will never require removing from an empty list
#
# EXAMPLES
# push_or_pop([10])            => [10]
# push_or_pop([10, 4])         => []
# push_or_pop([10, 20, 30])    => [10, 20, 30]
# push_or_pop([10, 20, 2, 30]) => [10, 30]

numbers = [10, 20, 2, 30]
