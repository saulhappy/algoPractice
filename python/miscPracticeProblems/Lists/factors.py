# Write a factors function that accepts a positive whole number
# It should return a list of all of the number's factors in ascending order
# HINT: Could the range function be helpful here? Or maybe a while loop?
#
# EXAMPLES
# factors(1)  => [1]
# factors(2)  => [1, 2]
# factors(10) => [1, 2, 5, 10]
# factors(64) => [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]

def factors(number):
    result = []
    for num in range(1, number + 1):
        if number % num == 0:
            result.append(num)
    return result


print(factors(64))
