# Declare a nested_extraction function that accepts a list of lists and an index position.
#
# The function should use the index as the basis of finding both the nested list
# and the element from that list with the given index position
#
# You can assume the number of lists will always be equal to
# the number of elements within each of them.
#
# nl = [[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
# nested_extraction(nl, 0)  => 3
# nested_extraction(nl, 1)  => 8
# nested_extraction(nl, 2)  => 12
