// Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

// Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

// Example 1:

// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
// Output: [4,1,9]
// Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
// Example 2:

// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
// Output: [4,5,9]
// Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

// Note:

// The linked list will have at least two elements.
// All of the nodes' values will be unique.
// The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
// Do not return anything from your function

const L = require("./customLinkedList");
const List = L.LinkedList;
const Node = L.Node;

const l = new List();

const a = new Node(1);
const b = new Node(2);
const c = new Node(3);
const d = new Node(4);

a.next = b;
b.next = c;
c.next = d;

l.head = a;

console.log(l.size());
console.log(l.printList());

l.deleteNode(c);

console.log(l.size());
console.log(l.printList());
